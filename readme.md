## Getting Started

We provide a python package for easy installation and model predictions

Installation of the Python Package
```
pip install git+https://github.com/marccoru/marinedebrisdetector
```

or 
```
git clone https://github.com/MarcCoru/marinedebrisdetector.git
cd marinedebrisdetector
pip install .
```

You now have a `marinedebrisdetector` program to make predictions of Sentinel-2 tif images on the console.
Check `marindebrisdetector --help` for information on parameters and options.

Predict the qualitative test images from the paper with this command.
```
marinedebrisdetector --plot-qualitative
```

predict a Sentinel-2 scene (Durban) with these commands
```
# download example scene (~300 MB) to ("durban_20190424.tif")
marinedebrisdetector --download-durban

# predict the durban example scene
marinedebrisdetector durban_20190424.tif
```
the prediction should be in the same folder named `durban_20190424_prediction.tif`. You can inspect the prediction scene in any image viewer, 
but best in a GIS program [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) or [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html) that allows you inspect and overlay other georeferenced data.

The tested prediction times of the scene prediction above are:
* 11 sec on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090
* 15 sec on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970
* 11 minutes on Macbook Pro CPU

### Pre-trained Models

We provide pre-trained weights for 12-channel Sentinel-2 imagery.
A detailed list of weights can be found on the [models page](doc/models.md)

pretrained segmentation models can be loaded via the torch hub in python
```python
import torch

torch.hub.load("marccoru/marinedebrisdetector", "unetpp")
torch.hub.load("marccoru/marinedebrisdetector", "unet")

# trained without label refinement (can lead to thinner more fine-grained predictions)
torch.hub.load("marccoru/marinedebrisdetector", "unetpp", label_refinement=False)
```

The `marinedebrisdetector` defaults to the `unetpp/unet++`.

### Datasets

We trained the underlying [Unet++ segmentation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10165) (implementation from [Pytorch Segmentation Models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch)) on an aggregated a combination of existing datasets for training [FloatingObjects Dataset (Mifdal et al., 2020)](https://github.com/ESA-PhiLab/floatingobjects), [Marine Debris Archive (Kikaki et al., 2022)](https://marine-debris.github.io/), [S2Ships (Ciocarlan et al., 2021)](https://github.com/alina2204/contrastive_SSL_ship_detection),
and newly annotated a refinedFloatingObjects dataset and Sentinel-2 images of the [Plastic Litter Projects (Papageorgiou et al., 2022; under review)](https://plp.aegean.gr/)

More details in a dedicated [data page](doc/data.md). 
Executing the training script ([see this "model training" page](doc/model_training.md)) with `--download` will automatically download and uncompress the required datasets (116 GB (uncompressed)).




### Model Training

We provide a [a training script](marinedebrisdetector/train.py) powered by [Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) and [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to train new models and reproduce our results.
More details on training commands and ablations in a dedicated page for [model training](doc/model_training.md)
